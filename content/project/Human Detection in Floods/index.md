A project done at my time as software engineer at UTS for Search And Rescue Operation. The aim of the project was to fly drones in the flooded areas and deploy life vests to the people drowning. The product was a complete software solution with a WebApp GUI for monitoring the live drone feed. The camera's on the drone could be switched between RGB and thermal with seperate models available for each use case and geographical scenarios.
