Physical distancing has been shown to be one of the most effective tools to ensure lowered transmission rates of COVID-19 and to protect the Australian population. As we transition from responding to the impacts of the virus into recovery, maintaining vigilance about distancing is critically important (particularly in public and recreational spaces).

However some people seem to disregard this in areas of mass congregation, especially at recreational areas such as beaches and parks where it is difficult to manage social distancing. A simple solution is to fly drones that can automatically detect clusters of people in real time, determine appropriate physical distancing is in place, and can alert people if they are putting others at risk.
